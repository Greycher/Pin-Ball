There is a Builds folder under the root folder that keeps two seperated builds anemly first trial and second trial.

There is a Control.txt file that describes the controls.

THE THING I WOULD LIKE TO TELL
I have made two seperate attempts.

In my first attempt, I went between using joints or faking the physic. Because of my lack of experience over joints, I end up failing both. In this attempt,I framed my self with two hours and tried to fake the physics after realising
that working with joints needs tweaking and time. But in general i dont think that is a task that can be fit in two hours. You are making level from boxes and it takes time also.

In my second attempt i have omitted the two hour frame on my mind and aim to make a playable game loop. The result is not perfect but as I wrote earlier working with physic takes time and tweaking and also I did not get to work on 
physic-based games that much. This attempt took me around 4.5 hours and i think the outcome is a decent material which can be dramatically improved by just tweaking. There was not a lot of point that scripts involved. Basically 
physic simulation and Unity's built in joints made the most of the work. So the few scripts I have written are simple thought and coded.
